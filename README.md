# Js Sandbox example

This is a simple exmaple of how to sandbox javascript code using iframes and proxies

# How does it work?

- Blue realm is the main realm
- Creates an iframe and extract its contentWindow
- Proxies any access to window attributes
  - NOTE: Using this same technique one could proxy any js instrinsic
- Evaluates code with eval (red realm) in the context of the contentWindow (red realm) (using with)
  - When evaluating this code endowments are added to the contentWindow
  - When the code tries to access any JS intrinsic (e.g. document.querySelector) it first goes to the proxy handler
  - The proxy handler decides what to return to the code, here the proxy calls the distortion callback that might decide to return something different.
- Thereâ€™s no data serialization because all the objects are running in the same process.
- If the blue realm calls code from the red realm (e.g. an event handler). The red code still executes inside that original `with` when was first invoked, thus, is sandboxed.

    participant blue as Blue Window
    participant proxy as Proxy Handler
    participant red as Red Window
    blue ->> red: Handle (onClick)
    red ->> red: run handleClick
    Note right of red: handleClick tries to<br> run a fetch() request
    red ->> proxy: get fetch function
    Note over red, proxy: This is not the fetch call itself, this is<br>"give me the function object I'll use<br> when I call fetch"
    proxy ->> blue: should distord [fetch] ?
    blue ->> proxy: use [distortedFetch]
    proxy ->> red: use [distortedFetch] (modified object)
    Note over red, proxy: Returns a function that will<br> be called as the "fetch" function
    red ->> red: run fetch
    Note right of red: Code runs a fetch() request<br> using the distorted fetch function
